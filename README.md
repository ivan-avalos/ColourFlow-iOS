#  ColourFlow

Enjoy watching the colours change from one to another with a beautiful ripple animation and feel more relaxed. Nothing else, just colours and animations, this will help some people to calm down and relax (including me).

## All about colours

Colours in this app are not just colours, all of them have been taken from the [Material Design Color Tool](https://material.io/tools/color), which provides beautiful colour palettes that are more than colors: they are smart and natural colours designed to provide the best user experience possible.
