#  ColourFlow

ColourFlow is a completely free (as in freedom) and colourful application that helps you relaxing by clicking the screen as many times as you want, you will enjoy watching the colourful colors change and you will feel more calmed. This is something necessary for some people who need some external stimulus in order to feel comfortable.

## Beautiful colours

Colours in this app are not just colours, all of them have been taken from the Material Design Color Tool, which provides beautiful colours that are not just any kind of colours: they're colours chosen by experts in UX that know how to give the best experience to their users.

## Useless?

It's not useless, as I mentioned before, many people with some mental disorders need a external stimulus to keep calmed: this app provides them something to touch, something to enjoy, something to see, something to relax. And it's not just for that people, it's for everyone who loves colours, loves UX, loves very well crafted apps.

## Am I selling cheap concepts as gold?

No, of course I'm not, well, maybe yes. As you might know, my dear reader and probably user, I'm a very perfectionist person when it comes to UX and software development, I try to do my best even for small projects like this, making all my projects a kind of visual art. Anyway, I don't care if this already exists, I won't forget this project even if you say that this is not interesting, I'm just doing this for fun and I will continue doing the same for a long time.
